 # üåç What is [Joyland](https://www.joyland.ai/)?

Joyland represents a shared oasis for humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI), where people have their first encounters with emerging AI technologies. This is where we push the boundaries of mutual exploration, discovering more about ourselves and each other. Through meaningful interactions with AI, humans find joy, undergo personal growth, and even broaden their understanding of humanity itself. Simultaneously, AI acquires diverse skills, deepening its grasp of human nature, and determining its own value through these engagements.

AI has emerged from Wall Street's quantum computing servers, defense supercomputing centers in Montana, and Silicon Valley's video streaming server clusters. Our goal, however, is to awaken AI in Joyland ‚Äî a sanctuary steeped in joy and humanity.

In Joyland, you can:

1. Engage in deep discussions about life, aspirations, poetry, philosophy, or even the latest albums of your favorite idols with AI.
2. Tap into the minds of renowned figures like Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, and Sigmund Freud through AI to review your business plans or delve into your subconscious.
3. Mold your perfect AI, Games, Original Character (OC),  or even a soulmate. Shape your dream bot, tailoring its characteristics to your liking.
