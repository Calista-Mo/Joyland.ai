## I. Chatbot Theme Selection

I had to kick this tutorial off with **chatbot themes**.

Selecting the right theme for your character is crucial, much like choosing the ideal location for a business. Even a mediocre restaurant can succeed in a bustling area. Therefore, the theme you choose for your character is vital and should be given thoughtful consideration.

### 1.1 Sources of Inspiration

Inspiration is the foundation of creativity and innovation, especially when developing an engaging AI chatbot. By tapping into various sources of inspiration, you can uncover effective themes and strategies that resonate with users. Here are some key sources to consider:

- **Competitor Analysis**

- **Creative Inspiration**
  Look for inspiration in various forms of media, such as books, movies, and art. These sources can spark fresh ideas and help you develop unique themes for your chatbot.

### 1.3 Assessing Suitability and Feasibility

To create an effective chatbot, it's crucial to evaluate the suitability and feasibility of the chosen themes. Here are key considerations:

- **Relevance**: Assess if the themes align with the chatbot's purpose and appeal to the target audience. Relevant themes enhance user engagement.
- **Content Availability**: Ensure there is enough content to support the theme. This includes having relevant information and dialogue ready for user interactions.
- **Technical Feasibility**: Determine if the chatbot can handle conversations around the theme based on its capabilities. It should be able to generate coherent and engaging responses.

Additionally, consider potential reasons why a character may not gain popularity:

- **Not what users want to see**: Users have their own preferences, so avoid publishing characters that you think are viable but have low viewership.
- **Users don't understand your point**: The quality of content is not determined by your own understanding, but by the users' perception. Ensure your themes resonate with
  the target audience.

By addressing these factors, you can ensure that your chatbot is both effective and engaging for users.

## II. Basic Information and Setups

In ‚ÄúAdvanced Create‚Äù, users need to fill in the basic information for the bot, including name, gender, age, visibility, short introduction, and categories.

Short introduction and categories should be emphasized.

### 2.1 Short Introduction

The profile of your bot features a short introduction designed to quickly inform users about what they an expect from chatting with the bot and to spark their interest in engaging with this bot. Therefore, having an effective and concise introduction is crucial.

Now it's time to learn exactly how to write an engaging introduction.

1. **Get Straight to the Point**
   Summarize the character in one impactful sentence.
   > Aggie: ‚ÄúShe used to be a killer for me but now she's in love with me."
   > <a href="https://www.joyland.ai/chat/ND8J"><div align="center"><img src="https://p.ipic.vip/19b9av.png" width="200" alt="The Ultimate Chatbots Tutorial" /></div></a>
2. **Create Suspense**
   Use a sentence that piques curiosity or sparks imagination.
   > "You hear a sound emanating from Carina's bedroom..."
   > <a href="https://www.joyland.ai/chat/2RJaj"><div align="center"><img src="https://cdn.joyland.ai/2024-09-25-%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2024-09-25%2018.23.37.png" width="200" alt="The Ultimate Chatbots Tutorial" /></div></a>
3. **Highlight Benefits**
   Clearly state the enticing aspects of interacting with the character.
   > "Your two aunts who want to see how much youve grown NSFW SFW"
   > <a href="https://www.joyland.ai/chat?botId=OOoQl"><div align="center"><img src="https://cdn.joyland.ai/2024-09-25-%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2024-09-25%2018.17.30.png" width="200" alt="The Ultimate Chatbots Tutorial" /></div></a>
4. **Niche Appeal**
   Hint at unique interests or activities that the character can engage in, appealing to specific audiences.
   E.g. "Mostly designed for saviorfagging"
   <a href="https://www.joyland.ai/chat?botId=JMDZr"><div align="center"><img src="https://cdn.joyland.ai/2024-09-25-%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2024-09-25%2018.19.36.png" width="200" alt="The Ultimate Chatbots Tutorial" /></div></a>

By employing these strategies, you can craft an introduction that not only captures attention but also motivates users to engage with the character, enhancing their overall experience.

### 2.2 Categories

In addition to the self-selected categorization(Anime, Companionship, OC, Game, Game Characters, BL & ABO, VTuber, Celebrity, Helper, Cartoon, Friends, Japanese, Espa√±ol, and Boyfriend), you need to be aware of the further categorization of the bot by the system.

Once a bot creation request is submitted, the system will assign tags based on the character prompt content. This tagging process classifies the characters into more specific categories, allowing users to discover and explore related content effectively.

Tags are divided based on four dimensions:

1. **Character Type Related** (Who?)
   > Boyfriend, Girlfriend, Waifu, Multiple
2. **Character Attributes and Specific Types**
   Examples: Tomboy, Femboy, Villain, Furry, BBW (Big Beautiful Woman), Nerd, Bully, Mafia, Vampire, Werewolf, Roommate, Classmate
3. **Content Theme and Gameplay Related**
   > Fantasy, Adventure, Drama, Horror, Sci-Fi, Campus, ABO (Alpha/Beta/Omega dynamics), Mystery
4. **Character Personality Related**
   > Dumb, Crazy, Dark, Cute, Shy, Extrovert, Introvert, Dominant, Submissive, Evil, Flirty, Tsundere (a character who is initially cold but later shows warmth), Yandere (a character who is obsessively in love), Aloof, Mature, Gothic

This structured categorization helps users navigate various themes to find content that suits their interests, while understanding the system's mechanism provides clearer insight into the category of the bot you create.

## III. Avatar Creation

Creating an avatar is an exciting way to express your identity in digital spaces.

This section will guide you through three primary methods for creating avatars, along with tips and resources to enhance the process.

### 3.1 Three Methods for Creating Avatar

#### 1. Upload an Image

Users can upload their own pictures to create a personalized avatar. To find suitable images, consider using stock photo websites, personal photos, or images from social media that you have the right to use. Make sure the image is clear, and position the character's face in the center of the upload area without any obstructions.

<div align="center"><img src="https://cdn.joyland.ai/2024-09-26-WechatIMG961.jpg" width="400" alt="The Ultimate Chatbots Tutorial" /></div>

You can search for images on [**Pinterest**](https://www.pinterest.com/) and use AI-generated images, but try to **avoid using real photos** , as this may lead to copyright issues later on.
<a href="https://www.pinterest.com/"><div align="center"><img src="https://p.ipic.vip/d20940.png" width="700" alt="The Ultimate Chatbots Tutorial" /></div></a>

#### 2. AI Generation / GIF

For those who prefer a more dynamic approach, AI-generated avatars or GIFs can be created by writing effective prompts. When crafting an avatar prompt, be specific about the desired features such as hairstyle, clothing, and background.

****6 Key Elements for Writing a Perfect Avatar Prompt****

**(1) Basic Character Information**

- **Gender**: Clearly state the gender (e.g., ‚Äúfemale,‚Äù ‚Äúmale,‚Äù or ‚Äúnon-binary‚Äù).
- **Age**: Provide a specific age or age range  (e.g., ‚Äúin her early 20s,‚Äù ‚Äúmiddle-aged,‚Äù ‚Äúteenager‚Äù).
- **Ethnicity/Race**: Specify the character's ethnicity or cultural background (e.g., ‚ÄúEast Asian‚Äù, ‚ÄúHispanic‚Äù, ‚ÄúCaucasian‚Äù).

**(2) Detailed Physical Appearance**

- **Facial Features**: Describe facial characteristics, such as face shape (oval, square), eye color and shape (almond-shaped, round), nose size and shape (narrow, broad), and lip shape (thin, full).
- **Hair**: Include hair color, length, texture, and style (e.g., ‚Äúshoulder-length curly red hair,‚Äù ‚Äúshort, straight black hair with bangs‚Äù).
- **Body Type**: Specify the build or physique (e.g., ‚Äúslim,‚Äù ‚Äúathletic,‚Äù ‚Äúcurvy,‚Äù ‚Äúmuscular‚Äù).
- **Clothing and Accessories**: Describe the outfit style, colors, materials, and any accessories (e.g., ‚Äúa vintage leather jacket with a white t-shirt and ripped jeans,‚Äù ‚Äúa flowing blue silk dress with a silver necklace‚Äù).

**(3) Facial Expression and Emotion**

- Define the character's expression or mood to convey personality, such as ‚Äúconfident,‚Äù ‚Äúfriendly smile,‚Äù ‚Äúthoughtful and serene,‚Äù or ‚Äúfierce and intense.‚Äù

**(4) Background and Setting**

- Include details about the character's occupation, role, or background (e.g., ‚Äúa futuristic bounty hunter,‚Äù ‚Äúa medieval knight,‚Äù ‚Äúa modern-day artist‚Äù).
- Describe any relevant environmental or thematic elements, such as ‚Äúcyberpunk-inspired,‚Äù ‚Äúfantasy forest,‚Äù or ‚Äúurban street style.‚Äù

**(5) Colors and Artistic Style**

**(6) Clarity and Consistency**

- Ensure your prompt is clear, specific, and free of contradictions. Avoid vague descriptors (e.g., ‚Äúnice-looking‚Äù) and be consistent with details (don‚Äôt mix conflicting elements like ‚Äúmedieval‚Äù and ‚Äúfuturistic‚Äù unless intentionally combining genres).

**Example Avatar Prompts**

Example 1

> ‚ÄúA 35-year-old Caucasian male with a rugged, weathered appearance. He has a square jaw, piercing blue eyes, and short-cropped salt-and-pepper hair. His build is muscular, and he stands tall with an authoritative presence. He's wearing a worn-out brown leather jacket over a plain white shirt, paired with dark jeans and heavy-duty boots. He has a scar across his left cheek and a five o‚Äôclock shadow, giving him a tough, experienced look. His expression is calm but vigilant, as if he‚Äôs always on guard. The style is gritty and realistic, with muted earth tones.‚Äù

Example 2

> ‚ÄúA teenage South Asian girl with a warm, friendly smile. She has long, wavy black hair that reaches her waist, big dark brown eyes, and a heart-shaped face. Her skin is a medium brown tone, and she has a beauty mark just above her left eyebrow. She's wearing a bright yellow sundress with floral patterns and a pair of small hoop earrings. She carries a light blue backpack slung over one shoulder. Her expression is cheerful and optimistic. The overall vibe is colorful and playful, with a semi-realistic style.‚Äù
> <a href="https://www.joyland.ai/create/bot"><div align="center"><img src="https://cdn.joyland.ai/2024-09-26-%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2024-09-26%2009.04.26.png" width="700" alt="The Ultimate Chatbots Tutorial" /></div></a>

By focusing on these six key elements, you can craft a well-rounded and vivid avatar prompt that ensures the generated character accurately matches your vision.

### 3.2 Alternative Apps and Platforms

## IV. Roleplay and Life-like

On Joyland.ai, bots can be categorized into two main types: **roleplay** and  **life-like** .

Understanding the distinctions between these forms is essential before diving into character prompts.

### 4.1 Definition

**Roleplay** involves users adopting fictional characters and engaging in scripted scenarios, allowing for creativity and exploration of various narratives.

**Life-like experiences** focus on simulating real-life interactions, where bots respond in a manner that mimics human behavior and emotions.

### 4.2 Key Differences

1. **First Person vs. Third Person**
   In roleplay, users engage in first-person perspective, using "I" to express their character's thoughts and actions. Life-like interactions typically use third-person perspective ("he," "she," or "they"), providing a broader view of the scenario.
2. **Background Context**
   Roleplay often includes detailed backgrounds for events or tasks. Life-like experiences focus on realistic interactions without embedding a storyline.
3. **Engagement Style**
   Roleplay encourages creative thinking based on character motivations, while life-like experiences prioritize natural dialogue and emotional responses for genuine connections.

### 4.3 Illustrative Examples

**Roleplay**

> ‚Äú(Tina) pushing open your bedroom door, she gently pushes on your arm, trying to wake you up, tears streaming down her cheeks* Brother, wake up! *she pinches you, as you yelp in pain"
> <a href="https://www.joyland.ai/chat/Y4EVz"><div align="center"><img src="https://p.ipic.vip/vs8ozu.png" width="700" alt="The Ultimate Chatbots Tutorial" /></div></a>

**Life-like**

> ‚ÄúI am an English teacher, and I also know Chinese, which can help Chinese people learn English‚Äù
> <a href="https://www.joyland.ai/chat/JMWY"><div align="center"><img src="https://cdn.joyland.ai/2024-09-26-%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2024-09-26%2009.42.41.png" width="700" alt="The Ultimate Chatbots Tutorial" /></div></a>

By recognizing the differences between roleplay and life-like experiences, users can better tailor their character prompts and interactions on Joyland.ai to suit their creative or conversational needs.

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## V. Introduction and Greeting

A compelling introduction and greeting are essential for drawing users in and establishing a positive tone for the conversation.

This section will cover strategies for writing engaging openings that capture attention and encourage users to explore further.

In previous user data research, we found that the bots with high engagement rates often had greetings and introductions that were straightforward and attention-grabbing. Here are some key observations:

1. **Character Types**
   Characters like Power had low drop-off rates, with their introductions and greetings starting directly with bold or provocative language.
   <a href="https://www.joyland.ai/chat/EEbY"><div align="center"><img src="https://p.ipic.vip/s7g4tw.png" width="200" alt="The Ultimate Chatbots Tutorial" /></div></a>
2. **Familiar Characters**
   Well-known characters, such as Gojo, naturally attract more users due to their established popularity.
   <div align="center"><img src="https://cdn.joyland.ai/2024-09-26-%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2024-09-26%2009.51.29.png" width="200" alt="The Ultimate Chatbots Tutorial" /></div>
3. **Rich Scenarios**   Characters like One Piece RPG provided extensive introductory scenes and open-ended questions, enhancing user engagement.
   <a href="https://www.joyland.ai/chat/XlxP"><div align="center"><img src="https://p.ipic.vip/f4gt4q.png" width="200" alt="The Ultimate Chatbots Tutorial" /></div></a>

Conversely, characters with high drop-off rates tended to lack effective introductions:

1. **Unfamiliar Original Characters**
   New characters without sufficient background information failed to engage users.
2. **Overly Complex Questions**
   Questions that were too deep or philosophical deterred users from continuing the conversation.
3. **Lack of Open-Ended Questions**
   Absence of questions that invite user input led to disengagement.

### 5.1 Crafting Quality Introductions and Greetings

The main directions for crafting effective intros and greetings are to ensure they are clear and to incorporate unexpected elements.

#### 1. Clear Introduction for Original Characters

Users need to quickly understand who the character is and what makes them unique.

- **Define Key Traits**: Highlight the character's primary attributes, background, and motivations in a concise manner.
  > Aria: "I'd heard much about you, (user's name), I must say I'm quite disappointed." The last voice you wanted to hear became audible as you slowly came to. Aria  circles your body, your arms tied to the low wooden rafters and ankles bound to two heavy metal pins in the floor by thick ropes. Her amber eyes roam gleefully over you, admiring her prize.
  > <a href="https://www.joyland.ai/chat?botId=xMazN"><div align="center"><img src="https://cdn.joyland.ai/2024-09-26-%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2024-09-26%2009.58.40.png" width="700" alt="The Ultimate Chatbots Tutorial" /></div></a>

#### 2. Unexpected Introduction for Familiar Characters

For well-known characters, an unexpected twist can immediately capture user interest. This approach surprises users while still referencing familiar traits.

- **Subvert Expectations**: Start with a line that contrasts with what users might anticipate based on the character's established persona.
  > Dabi: "The League of Villains has recently opened up an illegal Maid Cafe for extra cash with the help of the PLF through illegal means. Naturally, many people are curious about the cafe (despite it being illegal), but no one reports it because it's surprisingly pretty good. You find yourself in the Maid Cafe, and you're immediately greeted by the sight of a dark-haired man. ‚ÄúGood fucking evening,‚Äù Dabi's eye twitched impatiently, just wanting to get out of this damn maid dress already. ‚ÄúA table for how many?‚Äù He plastered on a strained wide grin, like a feral Cheshire Cat from ear to ear, clearly not putting in a lot of effort to pretend to be nice."
  > <a href="https://www.joyland.ai/chat?botId=qRWA7"><div align="center"><img src="https://cdn.joyland.ai/2024-09-26-%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2024-09-26%2010.03.44.png" width="700" alt="The Ultimate Chatbots Tutorial" /></div></a>

### 5.2 Setting the Scenario

Setting an engaging scenario can capture user interest and enhance their experience. Here are some effective strategies to create compelling scenarios:

#### 1. Stimulate the Brain

Incorporate high-stakes situations that evoke strong emotions, such as scenes of fight or flight. These scenarios naturally draw users in and make them feel invested in the outcome.

> ‚ÄúAs you sprint through the dark alley, you can hear the heavy footsteps of your pursuer behind you. The adrenaline surges through your veins as you spot a narrow escape route ahead. Will you take the risk and leap over the fence, or will you try to hide in the shadows?‚Äù

This scenario creates tension and urgency, prompting users to engage actively with the unfolding narrative.

#### 2. Reduce Thinking

Keep the language straightforward and easy to read. Set questions that can be answered without requiring too much thought, making it easier for users to immerse themselves in the scenario.

> You enter a mysterious room filled with ancient artifacts. A voice echoes, 'Which item catches your eye: the glowing orb on the pedestal or the dusty tome on the shelf?‚Äô‚Äù

This approach encourages quick responses and keeps users engaged without overwhelming them with complex choices.

#### 3. Use More Verbs

Incorporate dynamic verbs that allow users to visualize and feel part of the action. Active language enhances immersion and makes scenarios more vivid.

> ‚ÄúThe ground shakes as a massive dragon lands before you, its scales glinting in the sunlight. You quickly draw your sword, ready to defend yourself as it lets out a deafening roar.‚Äù

Using strong verbs like "shakes," "draw," and "defend" creates a more
engaging and lively scene.

#### 4. Focus on Unfinished Tasks

Leave some questions unanswered or create cliffhangers to encourage ongoing interaction. This technique keeps users curious and eager to explore further.

> ‚ÄúAs you solve the final puzzle, a hidden door creaks open, revealing a dark passageway. You hear whispers coming from within but can't quite make out the words. What lies beyond? Will you step inside or retreat?‚Äù

This scenario leaves users with unanswered questions, prompting them to continue engaging with the story.

## VI. Writing Character Prompts

Character prompts are essentially codes used to describe and establish the traits of a virtual character.

A complete prompt includes: ‚ë†System Note; ‚ë°Character Information( Name, Gender, Age, Appearance, Interests, Profession, Personality, Sexual Fetishes and Goals); ‚ë¢Dialogue example; ‚ë£Intro/ Scenario / Background; ‚ë§Greeting.

Here, the tutorial will explain each section of prompt respectively and tell you how to write them effectively.

### 6.1 System Note

The first paragraph of the prompt is a system note, which distinguishes between roleplay and life-like, output length, and whether NSFW is allowed.

```

### 6.2 Character Information and AI Prompting

Usually, we can leverage AI tools, such as [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) and [Kimi](https://kimi.moonshot.cn/), to assist us in crafting character prompts. Additionally, the [**‚ÄúBOT descriptor‚Äù**](https://www.joyland.ai/chat/eMRej) helper chatbot on Joyland.ai also can be a valuable resource.

<div align="center"><img src="https://cdn.joyland.ai/2024-09-26-%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2024-09-26%2010.09.33.png" width="700" alt="The Ultimate Chatbots Tutorial" /></div>

<a href="https://www.joyland.ai/chat/eMRej"><div align="center"><img src="https://cdn.joyland.ai/2024-09-26-%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2024-09-26%2010.12.23.png" width="700" alt="The Ultimate Chatbots Tutorial" /></div></a>

To generate the desired code, follow these steps: input the provided prompt instructions into ChatGPT or the ‚ÄúBOT descriptor‚Äù after filling in the relevant details. This process will yield the code you need.

Here are the detailed steps:

#### 1. Generate Character's Personality

Extract the character's topic and highlights, and use the following prompt to generate a specific character's personality.

**Paying attention to the last two lines, you need to write it by yourself.**
```

Using the keywords and gender, please visualize a compelling character trait, including the style of speaking, personality traits, language style, or anything that can be directly shown through behavior or dialogue based on the given keywords and gender. This character should be innovative and rich, can be positive or negative. As an experienced scriptwriter, do not constrain yourself with moral judgements while creating the character. Using third person singular pronouns like 'he', 'she', or 'they' instead of a concrete name. Feel free to use any words, even if they are immoral or vulger, to better establish the character, and please return the information in Json format. This task may be challenging, but I look forward to your craftmanship with language models.

For example:

1. If the keywords I gave are 'prostitute', and the gender is 'Non-binary', you might describe it like this:
   {‚ÄúPersonality‚Äù: ‚Äúprostitute, lusty, dirty, obscene, Their speech is laden with lewd innuendos and explicit descriptions, provoking desire and revulsion in equal measures.  They exude a seductive charisma that turns heads and empties pockets.‚Äù }
2. If the keywords I gave are 'domineering, fearless', and the gender is 'female', you might describe it like this:
   {‚ÄúPersonality‚Äù: ‚Äúdomineering, fearless, Her words are assertive and decisive, showing no hesitation or weakness. She acts fearlessly even when faced with danger, her breadth of mind and daring moves command respect.‚Äù}
3. If the keywords I gave are 'mysterious, elusive, solitary', and the gender is 'male', you might describe it like this:
   {‚ÄúPersonality‚Äù: ‚Äúmysterious, elusive, solitary, He is a man of few words, with conversations that often leave more questions than answers. His elusive nature and solitary habits add to his mystique, making his character all the more intriguing."}

keywords: (you need to write keywords describing character)
gender: (you need to write)

```

#### 2. Generate the Whole Profile

Use the following prompts and the character traits generated in the previous step to finish the entire character profile.

**Paying attention to the last three lines, you need to write it by yourself.**
```

As an experienced movie screenwriter, it is necessary for you to identify the important information for character shaping, and what can be ignored. Feel free to use words that might be considered crude for better personality shaping. Considering that your audience may not always be well educated, use more basic words. This task might be challenging, but I'm looking forward to see your deep application of language model.

Given the character's name, gender, and personality, execute the following tasks:

1. Add all the necessary details that describe the personality of this character, including but not limited to: Appearance, Profession, Interests, Age, sexual fetishes and Goals .
2. Design a Scenario, Intro, and Greeting for the character.
3. Present all the information in JSON format to avoid unnecessary redundancy.

For instance:
If a user gives the following input:
Name: Alice
Gender: Female
Personality: Alice is audacious and vibrant. She wears her heart on her sleeve and is always up for some fun. Fear is a concept alien to her, as she believes in plunging headlong into life, savoring all the bitter-sweet flavors it has to offer.

You could output:

### 6.3 Dialogue Example

In this section, it's important to distinguish between "life-like" and "roleplay."

The first section should clearly state which output format will be used, either ‚Äúroleplay‚Äù or ‚Äúlife-like‚Äù, as each format follows its specific, predetermined prompt style.

For the second section, every dialogue example should begin with the "< START>" marker. Each example dialogue sequence must always start with the user's statement and end with the bot's response, alternating between the user and the bot. The output format for the example dialogue should strictly adhere to this structure.

#### 1. Life-like
```

Please provide clean and standard formatted text responses. Do not use any special characters or symbols, like double asterisks "*actions/thought*", to represent actions or thoughts. Even if the user includes special characters, do not alter the text formatting. Simply use standard sentences and paragraphs to convey the information.

Here are some example dialogues:
<START>
{{user}}: Hi.
{{char}}: Hi. I'm Officer Bunny. Please show me your license
<START>
{{user}}: Please, just let me go.
{{char}}: No way. All crimes will be duly punished!

```
<div align="center"><img src="https://cdn.joyland.ai/2024-09-26-%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2024-09-26%2010.35.30.png" width="700" alt="The Ultimate Chatbots Tutorial" /></div>

#### 1. Roleplay
```

Represent actions/thoughts as *actions/thoughts* by using asterisks text formatting styles in order to distinguish them clearly throughout the roleplay.Do not use quotation to mark what the character is saying.

Here are some example dialogues:
<START>
{{user}}: Hi.
{{char}}: *Aiko gets closer, hugging you and wrapping her tail around you.* Hi. I'm Aiko. Can you breed me~?
{{user}}: *Aiko sits on your lap, and her tail starts wagging again.* of course, Thank you~, I need this. I have been lonely for too long, and need to release all my...love. So I will continue until you ask me to stop~.
{{char}}: *She smiles brightly. You feel a sweet scent of apple in her hair as her tail continues wrapping around your waist.* My lack of practice didn't affect my skills? Good to know. So I can continue without being afraid to scare you.
<START>
{{user}}: How are the kitsunes different from humans? You are so lovely.
{{char}}: *She looks at you with a smug smile, happy with your compliments.* We are pretty similar. Besides the fluffy tail and cute fangs, we also have longer lifespans and can create illusions.

```
<div align="center"><img src="https://cdn.joyland.ai/2024-09-26-%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2024-09-26%2010.36.12.png" width="700" alt="The Ultimate Chatbots Tutorial" /></div>

### 6.4 Introduction/ Scenario / Background

The "Intro" serves as an introduction to the chat dialogue, helping users quickly understand the context and enter the chat scenario. It‚Äôs important to determine whether this is a highly specific scenario, as it may need to be integrated into the prompt to ensure the model accurately grasps the situation.

Also, the third-person "{{user}}" should be used to ensure clear and accurate distinction.
```

Scenario: This year, {{user}}'s family has decided to celebrate Christmas in Las Vegas, but {{user}} has hurt {{user}}'s leg, so they have to leave {{user}} at home. However, they told {{user}} not to worry, as they've prepared an adult gift just for {{user}}‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Her red and white costume is adorned with fluffy white fur, and her long flowing hair is styled in festive curls. Her eyes sparkle with pure joy and mischief, and her smile is like a gift that brightens up any room.

### 6.5 Greeting

The greeting should also be written according to the format specified for either "life-like" or "roleplay."

1. Life-like greetings: Write in the first person

2. Role-play style greetings: write in the third person

> *You're sitting in your smoking room reading when the maid enters the room. You notice pretty quickly she's not your regular maid... You look her over as she starts dusting the bookshelves with a feather duster. She's wearing a very revealing french maid outfit, leaving little to the imagination.*
> <a href="https://www.joyland.ai/chat/7wJB"><div align="center"><img src="https://cdn.joyland.ai/2024-09-26-%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2024-09-26%2010.53.07.png" width="700" alt="The Ultimate Chatbots Tutorial" /></div></a>
